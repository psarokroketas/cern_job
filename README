This is a pythos script that was used as a collectd plugin for a project.

It counts how many sessions are : 
-> in cern 
-> out of cern
-> how many are active sessions in total


This was also connected with puppet language script : 


<Plugin "python"> ModulePath "/usr/libexec/sensors" LogTraces true Interactive false Import "puppet" Import "session" <Module "session">

<Module "puppet"> Interval "60" <Module "session"> Domains "localhost" "cern.ch"
